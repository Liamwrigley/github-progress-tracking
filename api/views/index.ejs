                        Yet another feature that the discord webhooks enable for me to implement easily.<br\>
                            I would however like to have a page that shows suggestions and allows upvotes so that I
                            can direct my efforts. This is doable at the moment but I dont want to spend time on
                            that when I am using SSR (means i'd have to refresh the entire page to show an update)

                        Add the ability to remove yourself from tracking. Right now I leave to auth to read
                        repo_scope on github too... I dont need it after I add it so I can remove it.

                        Not sure how I want to do this. Keep streak or to not keep streak? Maybe I can just track as
                        many repo's as the user likes. The streak counting is centralised and doesnt care where the
                        event comes from anyway..

                        This one is probably possible but the results are paginated so I wasnt enjoying it...<br\>
                            Basically if you initiate the setup and have a repo that you have already been pushing
                            to for a while, I want to start the streak from where you already are instead of
                            starting from day 1
